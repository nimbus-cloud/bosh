Building stemcell

Make sure there is no .ruby-version file under the root folder

cd bosh-stemcell
vagrant up local
vagrant ssh local
cd /bosh

Need to change ubuntu user uid to 1000, see this issue:
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/issues/807

Edit /etc/passwd and /etc/group and change uid and gip from 900 to 1000 and run:

find / -xdev -uid 900 -exec chown 1000 '{}' \+
find / -xdev -gid 900 -exec chgrp 1000 '{}' \+

Exit and restart the vm.
